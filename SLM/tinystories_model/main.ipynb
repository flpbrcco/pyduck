    "Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 are resource-intensive, requiring massive datasets and computational power. Small language models, however, offer a practical alternative for learning and experimentation on standard hardware. In this article I will be using the TinyStories dataset (~2 million training stories, ~20,000 validation stories) to build an SLM, using PyTorch for model implementation and Hugging Face’s tiktoken for tokenization. The code is optimized for efficiency, using techniques like binary file storage and GPU memory management to handle large datasets without overwhelming system resources.\n",
